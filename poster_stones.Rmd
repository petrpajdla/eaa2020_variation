# Introduction

There is a **lot** of variation in the shape and size of polished stone tools (axes, adzes etc.)
In archaeology, we use this variation to construct **types**, usually with
ascribed chronological significance.

```{r img-pca, fig.cap="Variation in shape of LBK adzes, side view"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/pca_side.png")
```

# Problem 

The **variance** in shape can occur in (*at least*) two points in time:

- During the **manufacturing process**
- During the **use** and **reparations** of the tool

Changes in shape during the **use** are limited to resharpening of the working edge of the 
tool or reparations of the part that is attached to the shaft.

The changes in shape during the use phase of the tool are thus usually minor ones but
stacked together, these might lead to larger differences.

In our point of view, the **manufacturing process** is nevertheless the main source of 
shape variation of the polished and beveled artefacts.

# Manufacture

```{r img-manuf, fig.cap="Idealized manufacture process (Toth 1992)"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/manuf2.png")
```

We have quite a good idea of the manufacturing process of polished and beveled stone 
tools thanks to *analogies* from New Guinea (e.g. Pétrequin -- Pétrequin 2011; Hampton 1999; Toth 1992 etc.)
and documented quarries (e.g. Prostředník -- Šída et al. 2005; Pétrequin -- Pétrequin 1998).

## A complicated process?

1. Quarrying a stone block
2. Rough flaking into an amorphous roughout
3. Fine flaking into a blank resembling the ideal final product in shape and size
4. Grinding the working edges or the whole surface
5. Fine polishing...

The process *needs to be **learned!***

## The case of LBK pottery

```{r img-pots, fig.cap="Simplified model of pottery traditions in the LBK (Claßen 2009)"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/pots.png")
```

> Premise: *Women* making pottery.

**Idea of change** in pottery *style* happening due to:

- exogamy (changing place of residence): 
  women from one *pottery tradition* comes to a region with a *different tradition*
- *acculturation and learning*: 
  the *newcomer* adopts the local *main motif* of decoration learned from *local women*
- *change*: 
  happens in form of adding *secondary motifs* of decoration that the *newcomer* brings from *her* home community

### Implications of the model

- Change happens only at a **certain moment of time**: 
  when the *newcomer* comes into the community and is combining the *local* and *foreign* *motifs*
- No space for own **invention** and **agency**.

<br>

# Model

> Premise: *Men* making polished stone tools.

If we apply the same model on the polished and beveled stone tools:

Men are mostly *local* (e.g. Bentley 2012)  
  &rarr; no *foreign* input &rarr; no **change**?

<!--
This is the `posterdown_betterport` template for the {posterdown} package! I was inspired by the twitter thread of [Mike Morrison](https://mobile.twitter.com/mikemorrison/status/1110191245035479041) and wanted to apply the `#betterposter` concept to the reproducible (yet simple to use) functionality of the {posterdown} package [@R-posterdown]. If you're not an R user don't sweat as you do **NOT** need to use it at all! Feel free to use only the Markdown functionality of this package :)

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c('posterdown', 'rmarkdown','pagedown'), 'packages.bib')
```

## Objectives

1. Pick a template layout.
2. Write/ create your poster content distraction free.
3. Let posterdown do its thing!

# Methods

I will show here how to include poster elements that may be useful, such as an equation using mathjax:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

To reference a citation you can add your `.bib` file to the working directory and name it in the YAML metadata or generate an automated one as done here, then you only need to reference the label value in the `.bib` file. For example this package is built on top of the wonderful {pagedown} package and I will cite it at the end of this sentance using this in the rmd `[@R-pagedown]` [@R-pagedown].

To get a better understanding of how to include features like these please refer to the {posterdown} [wiki](https://github.com/posterdown/wiki).

**_Now on to the results!_**

# Results

Here you may have some figures to show off, bellow I have made a scatterplot with the infamous Iris dataset and I can even reference to the figure automatically like this, `Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure)`, Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure).

```{r, irisfigure, fig.cap='Here is a caption for the figure. This can be added by using the "fig.cap" option in the r code chunk options, see this [link](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots) from the legend himself, [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui).', out.width="80%"}
par(mar=c(2,2,0,1))
plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width,
     col = iris$Species, pch = 19, xlab = "Sepal Length",
     ylab = "Sepal Width")
```

Maybe you want to show off some of that fancy code you spent so much time on to make that figure, well you can do that too! Just use the `echo=TRUE` option in the r code chunk options, Figure \@ref(fig:myprettycode)!

```{r myprettycode, echo=TRUE, fig.cap='Boxplots, so hot right now!', fig.height=6, out.width="80%"}
#trim whitespace
par(mar=c(2,2,0,0))
#plot boxplots
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Species,
        col = "#008080", 
        border = "#0b4545",
        ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
        xlab = "Species")
```

How about a neat table of data? See, Table \@ref(tab:iristable):

```{r, iristable}
knitr::kable(
  iris[1:15,1:5], format = "html",
  caption = "A table made with the **knitr::kable** function.",
  align = "c", col.names = c("Sepal <br> Length",
                             "Sepal <br> Width",
                             "Petal <br> Length",
                             "Petal <br> Width",
                             "Species"),
  escape = FALSE)
```
